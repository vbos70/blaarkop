# Big List Mean

These examples are based on https://donsbot.wordpress.com/2008/06/04/haskell-as-fast-as-c-working-at-a-high-altitude-for-low-level-performance/

## Build and run the test

The make target 'all' builds and runs (via *time*) the C and Haskell
versions:

    make all

The make target 'clean' removes all files generated for the 'all'
target:

    make clean
