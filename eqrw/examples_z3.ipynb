A theory is an element of the `Theory` class. Its constructor takes zero of more keyword arguments. The arguments `conts` and `variables` give the lists of constants and variables of the theory. The remaining arguments are supposed to provide the axioms, i.e., process-equalities, of the theory. The following example shows how this works. \n",
