The random selection of the population has  to be carefully constructed, because if certain groups of the population are under or over represented in the sub-set, the survey results will be biased.\n",

At the same time, alternative hypotheses are used to compute other probabilities of the same events. The predicted probabilities are then compared to frequencies of events in observed data. If the predicted probabilities of the null hypothesis match the observed frequencies, the data cannot be taken as evidence for a specific hypothesis. However, if the predicted probabilities of the null hypothesis do not match the observed frequencies while the predicted probabilities of a specific hypothesis do, then the data is evidence for that specific hypothesis."

For instance, when tossing two coins, we might reason that there are three outcomes: two heads, two tails, and a head and a tail. This is incorrect, because there are two ways to throw a head and a tail with two coins. Labeling the coins helps describing the two ways.

Suppose the total number of outcomes for rolling two dice is $N$. Then the (naive) probability of a sum of $11$ is $\\frac{2}{N}$ and the probability of a sum of $12$ is $\\frac{1}/{N}.

Rolling two dice with a sum of $12$ can only be achieved if both are a $6$ and therefore also here there is only one possible outcome.
